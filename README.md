# Leap Frog

## Brief Elevator Pitch
**Leap Frog** is a punishing but rewarding platformer about leaping to greater heights with the ever-present risk of falling back down. The mechanics are easy to pick up but hard to master, forcing players to learn how to time their charged jumps and movement precisely to succeed.  
You play as a small frog with dreams of leaving their little home among the dirt and grass, determined to make their way all the way to the moon. No matter how many times you fall, you can always try again.

## Game Instructions

- **Objective:** Reach the moon by colliding with the blue goal beacon just below it.
- **Movement:**
  - **Hold** and **release** the Up, Left, or Right keys (WASD or Arrow keys) to **charge** and **jump** in that direction.
  - Charge strength is indicated by a sound effect; maximum charge is reached after about 1 second.
- **Double Jump:**
  - Collide with a fly to pick it up (only one at a time).
  - While mid-air, press **Spacebar** to consume the fly and perform a **double jump**.
  - The fly respawns at its original location after use.
- **Ricochet Walls:**
  - Bounce off rocky walls and floating meteors for creative movement options.
- **Ice Tiles:**
  - Ice has reduced friction—you’ll slide if you don’t jump off quickly.
- **No Death:**
  - There’s no losing—you can always climb back up after falling. 
  - A timer tracks your speed for personal challenges and speedruns.

> **Tip:** If you’re struggling to jump when very close to an object, try backing up slightly before charging a jump.
